Hi.

1
00:00.900 --> 00:02.270
Welcome to my course.

2
00:02.310 --> 00:04.810
I'll guide you how to follow this course.

3
00:04.860 --> 00:07.790
This course is covering around 45 hours.

4
00:07.800 --> 00:12.260
Then it means you have to spend some extra time for learning this course.

5
00:12.300 --> 00:16.150
So I suggest you to complete this course in a timely manner.

6
00:16.290 --> 00:21.810
So you spend at least two hours per day so that you can finish it within a month.

7
00:21.840 --> 00:26.850
Then while studying you can watch whiteboard session and whatever it is discussion whiteboard session

8
00:26.850 --> 00:33.870
you can prepare notes if you want and every program is discussed on whiteboard so you can pause the

9
00:33.870 --> 00:38.430
video or at the end of the video you can start cording the program by yourself.

10
00:38.970 --> 00:45.590
So everything is discussed on whiteboard so you can do it by yourself. If at all you face any difficulty,

11
00:45.600 --> 00:50.730
then you can watch a coding video. Coding videos are also available and along with the coding video

12
00:50.730 --> 00:56.790
a PDF for full program is also available you can verify your program with that PDF content. The most

13
00:56.790 --> 00:59.730
important thing is analysis.

14
00:59.730 --> 01:05.240
There is a video on time and space complexity in the beginning of the course so you must watch that

15
01:05.250 --> 01:06.360
video.

16
01:06.360 --> 01:11.400
I have done analysis on each and every data structure and operations on the data structure. Now, while watching

17
01:11.400 --> 01:12.480
a video on analysis,

18
01:12.480 --> 01:18.480
I suggest you to practice it by yourself and if you are doing the analysis by yourself ones that will

19
01:18.480 --> 01:22.380
help you remembering the analysis and applying them in the right place.

20
01:22.380 --> 01:23.400
And one more thing.

21
01:23.400 --> 01:29.470
Asymptotic notations are used for representing the time complexities like Bigo, Omega and Theta.

22
01:29.490 --> 01:30.770
These are simple terms,

23
01:30.780 --> 01:32.160
These are nothing, without

24
01:32.160 --> 01:35.420
also you can represent the time complexity.

25
01:35.520 --> 01:41.040
These terms mostly confuse the students so even I have covered about asymptotic notations, You

26
01:41.040 --> 01:44.860
can watch the video available for asymptotic notations.

27
01:44.920 --> 01:50.850
I have discussed when to use Bigo, Omega and Theta but during my discussions I have not used these

28
01:50.850 --> 01:57.030
notations to make topic simple and easy for you to understand.

29
01:57.030 --> 02:00.080
At any place If you find any difficulty you can leave a message to me.

30
02:00.120 --> 02:05.460
You can go to question and answer section and then you can leave a message and if you have any trouble

31
02:05.460 --> 02:12.510
in coding you can send me a screenshot so that I can quickly reply you. So,  am there with you always whenever

32
02:12.510 --> 02:18.510
you face any difficulty you can put a question in the QnA section. That's all, you can start

33
02:18.510 --> 02:22.550
learning Data Structure course. Definitely, you will enjoy the course.
